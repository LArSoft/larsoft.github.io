# Developing With LArSoft

Any collaborator can develop or modify code and contribute it to LArSoft. On this page, we describe the procedures for submitting code (via a GitHub pull request), coding guidelines and policies, and other information that might be of use to LArSoft code developers.

## Quick links for Developing with LArSoft

-   [LArSoft repositories packages and dependencies](LArSoft_repositories_packages_and_dependencies)
-   [Overview page of LArSoft with SPACK](https://larsoft.github.io/LArSoftWiki/LArSoft_with_SPACK)
-   [Concepts in LArSoft](https://larsoft.org/important-concepts-in-larsoft/)

## Platforms

LArSoft currently supports the platforms listed [here](Supported_platforms). **Users who wish to develop on an unsupported platform may use** [a container approach](Developing_LArSoft_with_Containers).

## Compilers and language standards

Standard builds of LArSoft use the gcc and clang compilers, where the latter is used primarily to ensure language standards compliance. The versions of these compilers changes from time to time. Please refer to the distribution manifest for a particular release. The manifests files can be accessed by drilling down on the [LArSoft bundles page on SciSoft.fnal.gov](https://scisoft.fnal.gov/scisoft/bundles/larsoft)

The language standard for all LArSoft code is C++20.


## Designing

To design LArSoft code, it's important to understand the core LArSoft suite and all the components used by it. Reference the items below when designing new software.

### LArSoft architecture and design principles

### The *art* framework

-   [*art* documentation on WordPress](https://art.fnal.gov) for general information
-   [*art* documentation in Redmine](https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/art/wiki) for code specific information
-   [*art* workbook](https://art.fnal.gov/art-workbook/) for examples and tutorials
-   [Using art in LArSoft](Using_art_in_LArSoft)

### *gallery*

*gallery* provides lightweight access to event data in art/ROOT files outside the art event processing framework executable. It is not an alternative framework; rather, it provides a library that can be used to write programs that need to read (but not write) art/ROOT files. Information is available [here](https://art.fnal.gov/gallery/)

#### [Working with GitHub](Working_with_GitHub) and contributing code via LArSoft pull requests

Start by reviewing the information on [the overview page for using LArSoft with GitHub](Working_with_GitHub). Contact your experiment offline management to identify acting Level 2 managers. Send any comments to The Scisoft Team, or via Redmine issues.

#### git and git flow

NOTE: These are instructions for working with the legacy Redmine-based git repositories, and are recommended for experiments that continue to use Redmine for their experiment code. All LArSoft repositories have been moved to GitHub. Please refer to the instructions on the [Working with GitHub](Working_with_GitHub) page for current instructions on using GitHib and contributing code to LArSoft.

### External packages

These are package written and maintained by the general physics and computing communities for

ROOT and Geant4 do not use namespaces. In general, ROOT classes begin with “T” (e.g., [TTree](https://root.cern.ch/root/html522/TTree.html), [TH1](https://root.cern.ch/root/html522/TH1.html)) while [Geant4 classes](https://geant4.kek.jp/LXR/) begin with “G4” (e.g., [G4Track](https://geant4.kek.jp/lxr/source//track/include/G4Track.hh), [G4Step](https://geant4.kek.jp/lxr/source//track/include/G4Step.hh)). Exception: Some of the newer ROOT sub-packages have namespaces (such as `ROOT::Math::`, `ROOT::Fit::`, `ROOT::Minuit2::`, `Reflex::`, `TMVA::`).

Geant4 is accessed through the LArG4 interface package. More information is available at the [LArG4 wiki](https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/larg4/wiki)

Some of these packages duplicate functionality; e.g., 4-vectors are implemented in both [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/root/html522/TLorentzVector.html) and [CLHEP](https://proj-clhep.web.cern.ch/proj-clhep/doc/CLHEP_2_1_2_2/doxygen/html/LorentzVector_8h.html). Given a choice, use a package that's higher in the above tables over one that's lower; e.g., choose ROOT classes over their CLHEP equivalents.

### Policy for including new external packages in LArSoft

To include new external software packages into the LArSoft distribution, or to create a new external dependency:

-   An experiment makes an official request via redmine issue ticket.
-   LArSoft verifies that it has permission to use the tool for research.
-   LArSoft verifies that the package will be be used by more than one experiment. Note: if only one experiment intends to use the package, the SciSoft team can help, but the end product would reside in the experiment’s code, not in LArSoft.
-   LArSoft has to be able to build the tool such that it has binary compatibility with other products which will be used at the same time. This means that any dependencies (e.g., python) must be the same as those used by the matching LArSoft distribution. In addition, if the product contains C or Fortran code, the product must be buildable with the same compiler used by the matching LArSoft release.
-   If the package is built into LArSoft code, it must not have a license that affects the license of the LArSoft code. We must be able to distribute our LArSoft code without having to add their license to our code or change the way we distribute LArSoft code with it in there. For a package that isn’t linked into any part of the main LArSoft distribution, such as an analysis tool, LArSoft still needs to have permission to use the package for research, but isn’t worried about the licensing affecting LArSoft code.
